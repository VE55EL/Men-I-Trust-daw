            <p>
                Men I Trust are an indie pop band from Montreal. It all started with Jessy Caron and Dragons Chiriac,
                two childhood friends, joined by Emma Proulx as a singer. They released their first album in 2014, and
                have been doing everything themselves ever since: from shooting their own videos to releasing their own
                records, the band has been working with a DIY approach. Mixing and matching elements of indie pop, soft
                disco and trip-pop, they make a wonderfully chill and summery sound. 'Oncle jazz' the cheerful trio's
                third
                album, on which influences of Mac DeMarco, Clairo and Ariel Pink can be heard, was released in 2019. Not
                to be missed in the Orangerie on February 16th!

                Men I Trust was founded in 2014 by high school friends Jessy Caron and Dragos Chiriac, who reunited in
                the
                music department at Université Laval. They released a self-titled EP in 2014 and later performed at the
                Montreal
                Jazz Festival, Quebec City Summer Festival, and M for Montreal. They released the album Headroom in
                2015. They
                were later joined by the twenty-three year old Emmanuelle Proulx, a singer and guitarist who has
                participated
                full-time in the group since March 2016. The band toured in China, playing shows in Shenzhen, Beijing,
                and Shanghai.
                In 2017 Men I Trust released the single "I Hope to Be Around" with an accompanying music video. In 2018,
                they
                released the single "Show Me How" along with a self-directed music video. In 2018, they embarked on a
                North American
                tour. They performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 14 and 21, 2019. They also
                performed at
                Lollapalooza on August 3, 2019.

                From 2016 to 2019, they released twelve singles. Eight of them were reworked and included in their next
                album.
                They released the album Oncle Jazz on September 13, 2019. In a conversation with writer Nick Fulton for
                the music
                publication Billboard, the band noted that the green, solitary confines of rural Quebec were influential
                in shaping
                how the album sounded. "It put us in a really different creative mood and we were able to focus more,
                because there’s
                nothing to do outside of the house except for walking and thinking about music,” said singer and
                guitarist Emmanuelle
                Proulx. Oncle Jazz was long listed for the 2020 Polaris Music Prize.

                In 2020 Men I Trust released a live album Forever Live Sessions featuring songs from Oncle Jazz and
                other work. On
                June 16, 2021 they were featured in an episode of the NPR web series Tiny Desk (Home) Concert recorded
                in
                Quebec. The band announced their subsequent album Untourable Album on June 23, 2021, and it was
                released on
                August 25, 2021. It will be supported by a North American tour starting in September 2021.
